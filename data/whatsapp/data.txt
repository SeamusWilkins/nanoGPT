Molly <3 🐁: lil fun fact cute stuff
Séamus: hey baby
Séamus: aw thankuu
Séamus: for some reason people with disability accomodations start eaelier jm at 9:15?? tf
Séamus: would it be a bad idea to take an eepy pill? like making me groggier in the morning? i fear for my natural ability to sleep tho what with the equasym and insane amounts of coffee i had today
Séamus: its the only ratio in the world that means when u fold it in half, ratio remains the exact same
Séamus: yes i gave up on my project
Séamus: gonna submit late
Séamus: which pushes everything backwards 😭
Séamus: im gonna meet with my compsci friends tmrw and try get help tho
Séamus: i got distracted by watching the full ucd debate
Séamus: bunch of retards on each side
Séamus: each side refuses to condemn one sides atrocities its ridiculous
Séamus: thats why the fight broke out because the pro-palestine guy was being pressured to condemn oct 7 and he kept refusing he was dying on that hill
Séamus: lol like why come on just condemn it that doesn't make israel the good guys all of a sudden just because you admit mass rape, torture and burning alive of civillians is always wrong
Séamus: the few times that the IRA killed a big bunch of civilians, Irish people would condemn it, and that did not mean reteacting support for Irish independence let alone condemning IRA in general
Séamus: You deleted this message
Molly <3 🐁: i saw that before you deleted hahah
Molly <3 🐁: i’ll reply in a min i’m getting ready for bed.
Séamus: oh I'm sorry I just realized you probably don't wanna hear any mention of her
Séamus: *defo don't wanna
Molly <3 🐁: no i don’t,, think about how you would feel if it was the other way around. but at the end of day you’re mine. so what’s the point in getting triggered over it.
Séamus: yep I'm sorry baby
Séamus: cutie
Molly <3 🐁: no don’t be sorryyy
Séamus: #yours
Molly <3 🐁: but ya get me?
Séamus: i do babbles ofc
Séamus: that's why i delet lol
Molly <3 🐁: it’s ok cutie. i just saw bc my phone lit up but am cleaning and getting ready for bed. i have taken sleepy. i’ll brb. xx
Séamus: ok cutieface <3
Molly <3 🐁: that means you’ll be out earlier though! you still up to meet?
Molly <3 🐁: you’re still finding ways to get distracted by israel and palestine which is your biggest distraction!! where did you watch that?
Molly <3 🐁: it’s so important to have an open mind.. and actually try to understand others viewpoints even if you do not agree. i’m not surprised it got violent
Molly <3 🐁: yeah exactly. that’s a good example!! my goodness i’m the most patriotic person i love my country and am so passionate about it but i could never condem violence on innocent civilians
Molly <3 🐁: that’s a good idea!!
Molly <3 🐁: i’m sorry for only replying to this now and it may be too late. i would say perhaps you could take a quarter? and see how you get on w that if you still feel that the half is two sedating. i will say that medicating you  goes completely about my professional morals but alas we need to have you sleeping soundly. am  thinking of giving you some of my amitriptyline now i can’t give you as many bc they’re  a full  tablet and they’re my migraine preventative but i’ve given you one before and you slept well i think. they’re not as sedating either.. i will look into the half life of them now..
Séamus: ofc baby! are u?
Séamus: i havent blocked youtube on  my laptop cuz its nessessary for my project n such
Séamus: yeah i know stupid of me but sure look
Molly <3 🐁: mirtazapine stays in your system longer than amytrip!! you could take 2hrs before bed and i find that it doesn’t have that same effect of feeling like you’re fucking conked out
Séamus: yeah! also the ira didn't even do anything close to those atrociouties, civilian deaths were only collateral, not the actual intention
Séamus: yet we still could condemn it
Molly <3 🐁: very silly billyyyyyy i understand though
Séamus: so whys it so hard for mr richard boyd barret
Molly <3 🐁: yessir!!!!(:
Séamus: i mean 9:15 is 10.5 hours away
Séamus: is that long enough for it to wear off fully?
Molly <3 🐁: baby you don’t have any amytrip just the mirtaz i gave u
Molly <3 🐁: take a quarter now
Séamus: ok
Séamus: gotchu babi
Molly <3 🐁: i hope that helps
Molly <3 🐁: 🥺
